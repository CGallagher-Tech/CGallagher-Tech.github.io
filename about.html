        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm <strong>Cameron Gallagher</strong> — a Computer Science student at the
            University of Newcastle (UON). I'm passionate about building practical
            software that blends clean design with strong problem-solving.
        </p>

        <p>
            My main interests are <em>Artificial Intelligence</em>, <em>software
            development</em>, and <em>web technologies</em>. I enjoy working on
            hands-on projects, whether that's creating mobile apps, designing and modelling AI,
            or experimenting with game development.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of development, I'm dedicated to <strong>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</strong> and
            fitness. Training and competition keep me disciplined and focused — qualities
            I bring into my study and projects. I also have a huge love for the
            <strong>UFC and Star Wars.</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            My long-term goal is to grow into an <strong>AI software developer</strong>,
            creating applications that make technology more useful, accessible, and
            human-centered.
